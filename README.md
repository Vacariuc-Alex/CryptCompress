# CryptCompress
CryptCompress is a C++ project that illustrates the principles of object-oriented programming, such as abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, composition, and aggregation. It also utilizes specific elements of C++, such as exception handling, memory management using pointers, virtualization, data collections, and operator overloading.
## Algorithms
The CryptCompress project demonstrates the use of the Huffman algorithm for file compression and decompression, as well as a modernized Caesar algorithm for file encryption and decryption.
## Usage
1. Place the text file you want to process in the "files" folder, with or without an extension.
2. Run the CryptCompress application.
3. You will be greeted with a menu that allows you to select the type of file (plain, encrypted, or archived) and the operation you want to perform on it, based on the previous selection in the menu.
4. The final result of the processing will be saved in the same folder, with an appropriate extension based on the operation performed (.archived, .unarchived, .encrypted, .decrypted), depending on your selection.
## Final
CryptCompress is an extensible program with a good structure, written according to the principles of clean code. It employs design patterns that make the code easy to read, understand, and modify. Additionally, exception handling minimizes the risk of sudden and unexpected program termination.
## Requirements
To run CryptCompress, you need the following:
* Code::Blocks, an integrated development environment (IDE) for C++ programming.
* C++ compiler compatible with C++17 or later standards.
* Access to input and output files in the "files" folder.
